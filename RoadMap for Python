CREATING PYTHON VARIABLE:
  variables : Its a container which can hold a data inside it as value.
  NOTE: variable are case sensitive
        can't use space in between
        can't start with number and special symbols

DATATYPE USER - INPUT
  DataType:  
  Test-type: string (str)
  Numeric Types: Integer(int), float, complex
  sequence Types: List, tuple, range
  Mapping Type: Dictionries(dict)
  Set Types: Set, Frozenset
  Boolean Type: Bool, True, False
  Binary: Bytes, Bytearray, Memoryview.
  evaluate: eval -> mathematical operation, python function operation.

Type-casting and Substring:
  Implicit: Python itself convert one of the data type  
  Explicit: Where the user convert one datatype to another. 

PROBLEM QUESTION TILL NOW:
1. Write a program to display a person's name, age and address in the three different line.
2. Write a program to swap a two variable.
3. Write a program to convert a float into integer.
4. Write a program to take a details from the student for ID-card and then print it in the different lines.
5. Write a program to take an user input as integer then convert it into float.

OPERATORS AND OPERANDS:
Operands: indicates what operation is to be performed.
a, x, y
Operators: indicated on what the action or the operation should be performed
+, -, * ...

OPERATORS:
  Arthimetic: addition(+), sub(-), mul(*), Division(/), Exponentiation(**), Floor division(//) -> in quotient before decimal point, Modulus (%)
  Assignment: ==, +=, -=, *=.  
  Comparision: lesser than (<), Equal to (==), Greater than or equal to(>=), Greater than (>), Less than  or equal to(<=), Not equal to(!=). 
  Logical: and, or, not.
  Bitwise: AND (&), OR(|), XOR(^), Zero fill left shift (<<), zero fill right shift (>>)
  Identity: Is, Is not
  Membership: check the presence of a sequence in a object 
              In, not in

Conditional:
  if statement
  if - else statement
  if - else - elif statement 
  nested statement
  short hand statement: if <condition> : <body of if> 
  short hand if else statement: <body of if> if <condition> else <body of else> 

PROBLEM SOLVING:
1. Write a program to check the number is positive or not
2. Write a program to check the number is odd or even
3. Write a program to create area calculator
4. Write a program check wheather the passed letter is vowel or not
5. Write a program check if the number is single digit or not upto 5 digits.

INTRODUCTION TO LOOPS:
Types of loops:
  1. For loops
  2. While loops
  3. While True
  4. Nested loops

For loop: The loop that repeats something in a given range.
          The range of the starting point,
