INTRODUCTION TO LOOPS:
Types of loops:
  1. For loops
  2. While loops
  3. While True
  4. Nested loops

For loop: The loop that repeats something in a given range.
          The range of the starting point, and step gap in that
          add ending point while defining the range.
Syntax:
      for (variable) in range(1,6)

While loops:
          While loop executive till the given condition is True.
          in While loop increment is dine inside 
Syntax:
      while <body>
      while <condition>  
          <body of while loop>
          <Increment>

While True:
      Its a infinite loop
      To break a while True loop, break statement is used.

Nested loop: Loop inside the loop is nested loop.
             Nested loop is used to solve the patern problem.

For loop with conditional statement:
      Use If-else statement increase the ability of the loop to complete the task.

Break and Continus Statement:
    Continus statement: Its used when you want to skip the perticular statement.
    Break statement: Used when you want to destroy the loop at the perticular condition and come out of the loop.

Strings: Strings are the combination of number, symbols and letters, enclosed inside quotions.
Functions in strings part-1: 
1. length
2. count
3. upper
4. lower
5. index 
6. capitalize -> convert first letter into capital
7. casefold -> convert string into lower case
8. find -> find index of the number character    eg: print(a.find("a",15,34))
9. format {}  -> to write a variable inside a string    eg: a= "my name is {}"   print(a.format(a))
10. center(20, "*") -> fill the given character and centralizes a string

Function in strings part-2
a="hello"
b="Hello123"
c="123456"
d="HELLO"
e=" "
f="Hello 123@"
g=" 1.234"

1. isalnum - return true if all character in the string are alphanumeric
   print(a,a.isalnum())
2. isalpha - return true if all character in the stringare in alphabets
3. isdecimal - return true if all character in the string in decimal
4. isdegit - return true if all character in the string are in degit
5. isnumeric - return true if all character in the string are numeric
6. islower - check if the string is lower or not 
7. isupper - return true if all character in the string are upper
8. isspace - return true if all character in the string are whitespace (full string should be in whitespace) only space
9. istitle - return true if all character in the string (all first letter should be in capital)

Function in strings part-3
a = "Harry Porter"
1. endswith  -> returns true if the string ends with the specific value (case sensitive)
   print(a.endswith("r",10,12)) 
2. startswith()  -> returns true if the string starts with the specific value  (case sensitive)
3. swapcase()  -> lower case become upper case and upper become lower, vice versa.
4. strip()  -> return a trimmed version of the string (remove the extra spaces or dot or * in the string)
   print(a.strip())  # remove unessary the empty spaces from the string
   print(a.strip("*,"))
5. split()  -> split the string at the specific separator, returns a list.
   a=("#OFOTD#BRB#OMY#TB")
   print(a.split())
   print(a.split("#"))  # --> output in list
6. ljust  -> return the left justified version of string 
   x=a.ljust(20,"*")
   print(x, "is my favorite movie")  # --> after "a" the left shift by some spaces or a mention symbols.
7. rjust  -> return the right justified version of string. 
8. replace()  -> return the string with the specific value is replaced with a specific value.
   a="my name is john"
   print(a.replace("john","lisa")) # --> this not only for one work, it works for entire string.
9. rindex()  -> searches the string for a specified value and returns the last position of where it was found (basicaly to check the index number if the given)
   a="my name is john"
   print(a.rindex("john"))
10. rfind()  -> searches the string in a specified value and returns



Slicing in strings:
  1. string slicing
a="harry porter and the goblet of fire"
print(a[0:7])
print(a[0:7:2])

Lists:
  Lists are the collection of ordered and mutable data
  * List are written inside the square bracket
  * the value inside the list are written in bracket
  * mutable means once created, they can be changed
  * multiple datatypes can be written inside a list

Slicing Lists:

List Iteration:
  * Iteration using for loop
  * Iteration using for loop with range and length
  * Iteration using while loop
  * using Short-Hand for loop


List Functions Part (1):
  1. To find the length of a list
  2. To count a occurence of a perticular element
  3. To add to the list 
  4. To add the specific location
  5. To remove from a list
  6. To remove from a certain location


List Functions Part (1):
  1. To create a copy of the list
  2. To access the element
  3. To entend the list
  4. To reverse the list
  5. To sort the list
  6. To clear all the data from the list

PROBLEM SOLVING:

  2. Write a program to get the largest number from the list.
  3. Write a program to get the smallest number from the list.



TUPLES:

Tuples are the collection of ordered and un-mutable data.
  * For tuple no brackets are mandatory. By choice one can use parentheses.
  * The inside a Tuple is seperated  by comma(,)
  * Once created, typles cannot be changed.
  * Multiple datatypes can be written inside tuples.

Slicing and ItEration in TUPLES:

  * with for loop
  * alog with range and length in for loop
  * with while loop
