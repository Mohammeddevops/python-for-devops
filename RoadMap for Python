CREATING PYTHON VARIABLE:
  variables : Its a container which can hold a data inside it as value.
  NOTE: variable are case sensitive
        can't use space in between
        can't start with number and special symbols

DATATYPE USER - INPUT
  DataType:  
  Test-type: string (str)
  Numeric Types: Integer(int), float, complex
  sequence Types: List, tuple, range
  Mapping Type: Dictionries(dict)
  Set Types: Set, Frozenset
  Boolean Type: Bool, True, False
  Binary: Bytes, Bytearray, Memoryview.
  evaluate: eval -> mathematical operation, python function operation.

Type-casting and Substring:
  Implicit: Python itself convert one of the data type  
  Explicit: Where the user convert one datatype to another. 

PROBLEM QUESTION TILL NOW:
1. Write a program to display a person's name, age and address in the three different line.
2. Write a program to swap a two variable.
3. Write a program to convert a float into integer.
4. Write a program to take a details from the student for ID-card and then print it in the different lines.
5. Write a program to take an user input as integer then convert it into float.

OPERATORS AND OPERANDS:
Operands: indicates what operation is to be performed.
a, x, y
Operators: indicated on what the action or the operation should be performed
+, -, * ...

OPERATORS:
  Arthimetic: addition(+), sub(-), mul(*), Division(/), Exponentiation(**), Floor division(//) -> in quotient before decimal point, Modulus (%)
  Assignment: ==, +=, -=, *=.  
  Comparision: lesser than (<), Equal to (==), Greater than or equal to(>=), Greater than (>), Less than  or equal to(<=), Not equal to(!=). 
  Logical: and, or, not.
  Bitwise: AND (&), OR(|), XOR(^), Zero fill left shift (<<), zero fill right shift (>>)
  Identity: Is, Is not
  Membership: check the presence of a sequence in a object 
              In, not in

Conditional:
  if statement
  if - else statement
  if - else - elif statement 
  nested statement
  short hand statement: if <condition> : <body of if> 
  short hand if else statement: <body of if> if <condition> else <body of else> 

PROBLEM SOLVING:
1. Write a program to check the number is positive or not
2. Write a program to check the number is odd or even
3. Write a program to create area calculator
4. Write a program check wheather the passed letter is vowel or not
5. Write a program check if the number is single digit or not upto 5 digits.

INTRODUCTION TO LOOPS:
Types of loops:
  1. For loops
  2. While loops
  3. While True
  4. Nested loops

For loop: The loop that repeats something in a given range.
          The range of the starting point, and step gap in that
          add ending point while defining the range.
Syntax:
      for (variable) in range(1,6)

While loops:
          While loop executive till the given condition is True.
          in While loop increment is dine inside 
Syntax:
      while <body>
      while <condition>  
          <body of while loop>
          <Increment>

While True:
      Its a infinite loop
      To break a while True loop, break statement is used.

Nested loop: Loop inside the loop is nested loop.
             Nested loop is used to solve the patern problem.

For loop with conditional statement:
      Use If-else statement increase the ability of the loop to complete the task.

Break and Continus Statement:
    Continus statement: Its used when you want to skip the perticular statement.
    Break statement: Used when you want to destroy the loop at the perticular condition and come out of the loop.


PROBLEM SOLVING QUESTION FOR TH LOOPS PART-1:
1. Write the program to find sum of all even number up to 50.
2. Write the program to write first 20 numbers and there squared numbers.
3. Write the program to find first 10 odd number using while loop.
4. Write the program to check if the number is divisible by 8 and 20 upto 100.
5. Write the program to create a billing system at supermarket

PROBLEM SOLVING QUESTION FOR TH LOOPS PART-2:
A = "Why fit in, when you are bourn to stand out"
1. Write the program to find the length of the following string.
2. Write the program to check how many times alphabet "o" is occuring.
3. Write the program to convert the whole string into lower and uper case.
4. Write the program to convert the following string into a title.
5. Write the program to find index number of "fit" in.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strings: Strings are the combination of number, symbols and letters, enclosed inside quotions.
Functions in strings part-1: 
1. length
2. count
3. upper
4. lower
5. index 
6. capitalize -> convert first letter into capital
7. casefold -> convert string into lower case
8. find -> find index of the number character    eg: print(a.find("a",15,34))
9. format {}  -> to write a variable inside a string    eg: a= "my name is {}"   print(a.format(a))
10. center(20, "*") -> fill the given character and centralizes a string

Function in strings part-2
1. isalnum - return true if all character in the string are alphanumeric
   print(a,a.isalnum())
2. isalpha - return true if all character in the stringare in alphabets
3. isdecimal - return true if all character in the string in decimal
4. isdegit - return true if all character in the string are in degit
5. isnumeric - return true if all character in the string are numeric
6. islower - check if the string is lower or not 
7. isupper - return true if all character in the string are upper
8. isspace - return true if all character in the string are whitespace (full string should be in whitespace)
9. istitle - return true if all character in the string (all first letter should be in capital)

Function in strings part-3
1. ljust  -> return the left justified version of string 
2. rjust  -> return the right justified version of string
3. startswith()  -> returns true if the string starts with the specific value  
4. endswith  -> returns true if the string ends with the specific value
   print(a.endswith("r",10.12))
5. swapcase()  -> lower case become upper case and upper become lower, vice versa.
6. strip()  -> return a trimmed version of the string (remove the extra spaces or dot or * in the string)
   print(a.strip("*,"))
7. split()  -> split the string at the specific separator, returns a list.
8. replace()  -> return the string with the specific value is replaced with a specific value.
9. rindex()  -> searches the string for a specified value and returns the last position of where it was found (basicaly to check the index number if the given)
10. rfind()  -> searches the string in a specified value and returns
